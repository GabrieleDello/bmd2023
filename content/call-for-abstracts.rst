The previous four symposia were hosted at Delft University of Technology in the
Netherlands, Nihon University College of Industrial Technology in Narashino,
Japan, University of Wisconsin Milwaukee, USA, and University of Padova in
Italy.

This year the conference is coming back to Delft University of Technology to
celebrate over a decade of advancements in the field.

Please forward this invitation to anyone you feel might have relevant research
to present.

Additionally, if you have a contact at an organization that may be interested
in helping to sponsor our event or if you know anyone with an interesting
narrow-track vehicle for our rodeo, please let us know. In either case, you can
send details in an email message to sponsorships@bmdconf.org.

We invite you to submit a contribution to the conference and look forward to
seeing you in Delft!
