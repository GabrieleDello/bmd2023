Sponsor Information
===================

Delft University of Technology has a long history of innovation and a thriving
industry associated with bicycles, motorcycles, and associated technologies and
the research results produced by the Bicycle and Motorcycle Dynamics community
have helped advanced many commercially successful vehicle technologies through
a wide assortment of companies and organizations. We kindly ask any financially
able companies and organizations to consider sponsoring the conference. We rely
on financial sponsorship from companies and organizations to cover
approximately half of the conference budget so that we can keep registration
costs low while providing a high quality experience.
