Sponsor Information
===================

The Bicycle and Motorcycle Dynamics symposium is the premier international
venue for researchers into the stability, handling, and control of narrow-track
vehicles. In 2023, the event will return to TU Delft, where it began and where
there is a long history of innovation and a thriving industry associated with
bicycles, motorcycles, and associated technologies. We invite you to join the
sponsors of the event, come and meet the researchers, and introduce your
organization to them. Such sponsorships help keep registration costs low while
providing a high-quality experience.
