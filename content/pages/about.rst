The fifth triennial [*]_ international three-day symposium on bicycle and
motorcycle dynamics, BMD 2023, will return to its original host, Delft
University of Technology, on **October 18-20, 2023**. The aim of this symposium
is to bring together leading scientists and researchers in the field of bicycle
and motorcycle dynamics and control, in a broad sense.

Topics include but are not limited to: bicycles, motorcycles, unicycles, single
track vehicles, modeling, kinematics and dynamics, control, human control,
rider properties, handling qualities, tires, experiments, aerodynamics,
simulators, nonholonomic dynamics, robot riders, path following. More
information on the conference can be found at the `conference organization
website <https://bmdconf.org>`_.

For an open sharing of information, the meeting is organized to provide as much
interaction between participants as possible. The format is informal and fluid,
with a single track of presentations and extensive time scheduled for
interaction, and the forming and sharing of ideas. In addition, there will be
room for poster presentations.


If you are interested in being on the local organizing committee or sponsoring
the event, please send an email to Jason K. Moore (j.k.moore@tudelft.nl).

Check back for more information or sign up to the `Single Track Vehicles
Dynamics Discussion List <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/stvdy>`_ to
stay updated.

.. [*] Due to disruptions from the coronavirus pandemic, we postponed the
   conference from the fall of 2022 to the fall of 2023.
